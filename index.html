# 📦 dxlclient – Java Client Generation Guide

This document explains how to generate the **dxlclient Java JAR** using Swagger Codegen.

---

## 🚀 Generate Java Client

Run the following command:

```bash
java -jar swagger-codegen-cli-3.0.67.jar generate \\
  -i groupchatbotplatform_global_chatbot_platform_api-2.0.0-swagger.yaml \\
  -l java \\
  -o dxlclient \\
  -c config.json
```

---

## 🧾 Command Explanation (Simple)

| Option | Meaning |
|--------|----------|
| `java -jar` | Runs the Swagger Codegen tool |
| `swagger-codegen-cli-3.0.67.jar` | Swagger Codegen CLI tool |
| `generate` | Generates client code |
| `-i` | Input Swagger/OpenAPI YAML file |
| `-l java` | Generate code in Java |
| `-o dxlclient` | Output folder name |
| `-c config.json` | Custom configuration file (packages, version, etc.) |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration File (`config.json`)

```json
{
  "groupId": "group.buddy.dxlclient",
  "artifactId": "group.buddy.dxlclient",
  "artifactVersion": "2.0.0",
  "apiPackage": "dxlApi",
  "modelPackage": "dxlModel",
  "invokerPackage": "dxlInvoker"
}
```

---

## 🏗 Build the JAR

After generation:

```bash
cd dxlclient
mvn clean install
```

The generated JAR will be available in:

```
dxlclient/target/
```

Example:

```
group.buddy.dxlclient-2.0.0.jar
```

---

## 🔎 Compatibility Check (Simple)

Before replacing the existing `dxlclient` JAR:

- Keep same `groupId` and `artifactId`
- Do not change package names (`dxlApi`, `dxlModel`, `dxlInvoker`)
- Do not remove or rename existing API methods
- Do not change existing model field types
- Update version properly (e.g., `2.0.0 → 2.0.1` for minor changes)

Test by replacing the JAR in one service and running:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

If build and tests pass, the new JAR is compatible.

---

## 📌 Summary

1. Reads the Swagger YAML file  
2. Generates Java client code  
3. Builds a reusable JAR  
4. Verifies compatibility before release  
"""


## 🔎 Compatibility Recommendation

For better compatibility, it is recommended to:

- Compare the newly generated code with the existing `dxlclient` source code.
- Identify only the actual API or model changes.
- Manually update the required changes in the existing project instead of fully replacing it.
- Preserve existing package structure and method signatures.
- Avoid unnecessary regeneration changes (formatting, dependency updates, etc.).

### ✅ Recommended Approach

1. Generate the new client in a separate folder.
2. Compare it with the current `dxlclient` code (using Git diff or IDE compare tool).
3. Apply only required API/model updates to the existing project.
4. Rebuild and test.
5. Release with proper version increment.

This approach ensures:
- Backward compatibility  
- Controlled changes  
- No unexpected breaking changes in dependent services

Thank you all for your warm wishes,
As you all know, today is my last day here. I feel a little emotional speaking in front of all of you, but I also feel very thankful because I got the chance to work with such good people.

My journey in Vodafone started in 2020. In the beginning, Initially I interacted with Raj Kaliya, Bharat, Vivek, Prashant Gunjal and Vrushali.

Initially, I joined the VDC team. Then I moved to CSPI. I also explored the GNE project with Deepak, and it was a great learning experience.

One thing I always felt is that everyone was friendly and supportive from day one. It never felt like we were meeting for the first time. It felt like we already knew each other, and that made the workplace very comfortable.

I want to say a big thank you Bharat for trusting me, guiding me, and supporting me whenever I needed help.

I also want to thank all my colleagues. Some of you helped me directly in work, some supported me in small ways, and some made office life better with smiles, jokes, and friendly talks. I will always remember these moments.

Wishing you all the very best for the future—good health, growth, and success.
